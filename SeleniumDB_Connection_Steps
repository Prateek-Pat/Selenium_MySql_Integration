Note: need mySql Connector depencency or jar 

Steps for JDBC Connecction

1) Load JDBC driver  
2) Create Database Connection.
3) Create Statement 
4) Execute Query 
5) Perform operation using rs (ResulSet) object 
6) Close Connection

To check DB details follow below path
WorkBench DB > Database > Connect to Database 

To use Selenium Webdriver for Database Verification you need to use the JDBC (“Java Database Connectivity”).
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a SQL level API that allows you to execute SQL statements.
It is responsible for the connectivity between the Java Programming language and a wide range of databases.
The JDBC API provides the following classes and interfaces

Driver Manager
Driver
Connection
Statement
ResultSet
SQLException


In Order to test ur db using selenium below steps needs to be executed.
 
Step_1) Load the JDBC Driver using the code

		[Code]
		Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
		
Steps_2) Make a connecction to Database
		 Syntax: 
		 DriverManager.getConnection(URL, “userid”, “password” )
		 
		 Userid is the username configured in the database
		 Password of the configured user
		 URL is of format jdbc:< dbtype>://ipaddress:portnumber/db_name”		 

		 [Code]
		 Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(dbUrl,username,password); 
		 
Step_3) Once connection is made, you need to execute queries
		can use Statement Object to send queries.
				
		[Code]
		Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
		
Step_4) Once the statement object is created use the executeQuery method to execute the SQL queries
		
		[Code]
		ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(select *  from employee;);
		
Step_5) Results from the executed query are stored in the ResultSet Object.
		
		[Code]
        rs.getString(ColumnName) + rs.getString(ColumnName) + rs.getString(ColumnName)
        
Step_6) Close Database Connection 

		[Code]
		rs.Close
